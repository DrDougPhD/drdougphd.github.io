# Cheap International Shipping

The following are instructions for shipping a small number of coins internationally without costing an arm and a leg.
Your package will be shipped in a rigid envelope as a non-machinable letter without tracking.

1. Gather up shipping materials: envelope, a sheet of foam (<= 1/4 inch), box cutters, small zip-lock bag, scotch tape, cereal box or folder.
   e.g. Foam too thin, foam too thick, just right.
2. Using the box cutter, cut the foam into a rectangle slightly smaller than the dimensions of the envelope.
3. Insert your coin into the zip-lock bag.
4. Cut a hole in the foam roughly the size of the coin. Make sure the coin fits snuggly in the coin and can't wiggle around.
5. Insert the coin into the hole and apply tape over the top. This will prevent it from falling out of the hole.
6. Cut down a section of thin cardboard (e.g. cereal box) or cardstock (e.g. folder) to be as wide as the foam rectangle and twice as long.
7. Sandwich the foam inside thin cardboard/stock, taping the edges together at multiple locations around the edge.
8. Write out a customs form.

## TODO

Apply stamps.
Tape customs form to envelope.
Write sending and return address and 'non-machinable' to the front of the envelope.
Apply tape folded around the edges to reinforce the envelope from tearing.
Insert cardboard/foam/coin sandwich into envelope.
Seal the envelope, finishing with sufficient taping along the folding flap.
(maybe bring it to the teller?)
